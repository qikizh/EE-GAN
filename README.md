# EE-GAN

The project is an implement of our paper "Explore and then Exploit: A Fine-grained Hierarchical Network for Text-to-Image Synthesis", which has been submitted 
in a Chinese conference. 

Moreover, it also provides some convenient and clear implements of T2I functions, 
such as metric measuring and visualization.
In other word, These functions contribute to achieve your own T2I research 
or project.
